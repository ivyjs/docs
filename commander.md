# Ivy's commander

To help you out when it comes to developing your application, Ivy comes with user friendly command-line interface.
Commander is accessable by running `node ivy` in root directory of your project.

Help for each command is available with `--help` parameter, so `node ivy make:middleware --help` will display a help message of command, together with usage example.
